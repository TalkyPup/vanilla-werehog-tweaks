## Vanilla Verehog Tweaks v1.1
- The enemy jump height increase actually works now.
- Increased the speed at which those sticks Sonic can grab (pachinko) fling Sonic forward.
- Adjusted how slowly you need to mash for the lever/door/pachinko animation to play backwards to only be slightly slower instead of twice as slow. I think I didn't test this enough to fully understand what I was changing last time.
- The XML comments were originally for my own sake, but they're now much more comprehensive to help other modders know what's what.
- Created an update server.

## Vanilla Verehog Tweaks v1.0
- First release.
