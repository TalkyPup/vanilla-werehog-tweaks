## Vanilla Werehog Tweaks v1.2.0
- Added configs. Tweak presets can be chosen from on the HMM configure menu.
- Moved main mod files to the "All Tweaks" tweak preset folder.
- Added "No skips" preset. This setting excludes tweaks that can or could result in skips, such as the increased grab length and double jump height.
- Added "Walking only" preset. This setting excludes all tweaks, except for tweaks to walking speeds, walking delays, and analog stick values.
- Added "controller compatibility" versions of all presets. These settings revert the minimum "SlowWalk" and "Run" stick values to the game's default, preventing issues with certain analog sticks.
- Updates to some XML comments. Comments will only be complete in the "all" config.

## Vanilla Werehog Tweaks v1.1.1
- Testing the update server. Fixed a typo in this changelog.

## Vanilla Werehog Tweaks v1.1.0
- The enemy jump height increase actually works now.
- Increased the speed at which those sticks Sonic can grab (pachinko) fling Sonic forward.
- Adjusted how slowly you need to mash for the lever/door/pachinko animation to play backwards to only be slightly slower instead of twice as slow. I think I didn't test this enough to fully understand what I was changing last time.
- The XML comments were originally for my own sake, but they're now much more comprehensive to help other modders know what's what.
- Created an update server.

## Vanilla Werehog Tweaks v1.0.0
- First release.
